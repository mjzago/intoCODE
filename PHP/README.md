These files were created during the Dynamic Websites module and can be accessed and modified by users. To work with these files, it is important to have a proper directory structure and local development environment.

## Directory Structure:
Create a folder for your dynamic website project.
Within that folder, to store all PHP files.
Place other files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the appropriate folders.
Accessing and Modifying Files:

## Open
Open the PHP files in a code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++).
Examine the code and familiarize yourself with its structure and functionality.
Make any necessary changes to the code, such as updating variables, adding new functions, or modifying existing logic.
Working with the Files:

## Execute
To execute and test the PHP files, you need a local web server environment like XAMPP.
Install XAMPP and start the Apache server to create a local development environment.
Place the entire project folder (including the "PHP" folder) inside the appropriate directory (e.g., "htdocs" folder in XAMPP).
Access the PHP files through a web browser by entering the local server's URL followed by the file's path.
For example, if your local server is running on http://localhost/ and you have a file named index.php in the "PHP" folder, you can access it at http://localhost/PHP/index.php.
