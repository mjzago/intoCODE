# intoCODE Personal Repository 
Welcome to my repository for the topics I've learned in the intoCODE course! This repository serves as a collection of the projects and codes developed during my journey through the INTOCODE program offered by Hochschule Hannover (University of Hannover) in 2023.

## Course Overview
The intoCODE course provided an extensive curriculum covering two key areas: Data Science and Web Technology. The course structure consisted of nine modules in each area, with each module spanning two weeks and comprising 40 course hours. The modules were designed to provide comprehensive knowledge and practical skills in their respective domains.  For more information visit the course official website [intoCODE](https://intocode.de/)

## Data Science Modules
The Data Science modules offered a solid foundation in programming and data analysis. Starting with an introduction to agile project management and versioning, the curriculum gradually progressed through essential Python programming concepts, data structures, and data manipulation using popular libraries like Pandas and NumPy. The course also delved into topics such as descriptive statistics, simulation, visualization, machine learning, and natural language processing. The Data Science area is divided into three fundamental blocks of programming education, incorporating an introduction to Data Science (DS-Intro). Here is an overview of the Data Science modules:

#### 1. Agile Project Management, Versioning:
   - Introduction to agile work with SCRUM
   - Managing learning processes with EDUSCRUM
   - Social Intranet and team communication (Slack)
   - Collaborative software development using Git

#### 2. Python Fundamentals Quickstart (Python I):
   - Introduction to Python programming
   - DS-Intro: Basic descriptive statistics
   - Control structures and program development
   - DS-Intro: Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
   - Functions
   - DS-Intro: Measures of dispersion and other statistical indicators
   - Sequences: Lists and tuples
   - DS-Intro: Simulation and static visualization

#### 3. Python Data Structures (Python II):
   - Dictionaries and sets
   - DS-Intro: Simulation and dynamic visualization
   - Array-oriented programming with NumPy
   - DS-Intro: Pandas Series and DataFrames
   - Strings: A deeper dive including regular expressions
   - DS-Intro: Pandas, regular expressions, and data wrangling
   - Files and exception handling
   - DS-Intro: Handling CSV files in Pandas DataFrames

#### 4. Object-Oriented Programming and Computational Thinking (Python III):
   - Object-oriented programming with Python
   - DS-Intro: Time series and simple linear regression
   - Recursion, search and sorting algorithms, and Big O

5. Natural Language Processing (NLP):
   - TextBlob Library
   - Part-of-Speech Tagging
   - Sentiment Analysis
   - Stemming and Lemmatization
   - Visualization of word frequencies
   - Web Scraping as an exercise

6. Machine Learning I:
   - Supervised classification and regression methods using scikit-learn

7. Machine Learning II:
   - Unsupervised methods (Clustering) with scikit-learn

8. Deep Learning:
   - Neural networks for structured data (Dense Networks) with Keras
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing with Keras

9. Agile Programming Project in Data Science:
   - Machine Learning Challenge: Small groups compete to generate high-quality predictions from a given dataset


## Web Technology Modules
The Web Technology modules focused on various aspects of web development, including front-end and back-end technologies. The curriculum covered fundamental concepts such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks like Bootstrap and Django. Additionally, topics like databases (both relational and NoSQL), server-side programming with PHP and JavaScript, content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, user experience design (UXD), and mobile app development were explored.

1. Fundamentals of Web Development: Static Websites (Web Technologies 1)
   - Technical foundations of the internet: network architectures, communication,
processes, and protocols (HTTP, SOAP, REST, web servers like Apache/Nginx, ...)
   - Document structuring with HTML5
   - HTML frameworks (Bootstrap)
   - Layout and styling with CSS
   - Basics of JavaScript

2. Data Structuring and Databases
   -  Data formats and structures: XML, JSON, RDF, ...
   - relational data model: Databases with MySQL
   - NoSQL databases (MongoDB)

3. Dynamic Websites (Web Technologies 2)
   -  Server-side programming with PHP: Model-View-Controller paradigm, Framework Django
   -  Server-side programming with JavaScript: node.js

4. Content Management Systems
   -  Introduction to CMS
   -  WordPress for content editors: Authoring
   -  WordPress for developers: Customizing and developing themes and plugins

5. User Interfaces, User Experience Design (UXD)
   - Fundamentals of UXD, usability, and interaction design
   - Methods and tools for frontend concept and development
   - Responsive web design (device-independent web development), "Mobile
   - First," "Mobile Only," ... 
   - Mockups, wireframing, prototyping

6. Frontend Programming with JavaScript
   - JavaScript use cases and libraries

7. App Development
   - Native apps, hybrid apps, Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
   - JavaScript frameworks and libraries, e.g., React

8. E-commerce Systems
   - E-commerce websites with WordPress
   - Professional shops with Magento and WooCommerce

9. Agile Web Programming Project
   - Website Challenge: Small groups compete to create a website from a dynamically changing information pool.

## Open Repository
I have decided to keep this repository open and accessible to anyone interested in exploring the projects or code developed during the intoCODE course. Feel free to browse through the different folders and files to gain insights into the practical applications of data science and web technologies. While the repository primarily serves as a personal collection, I hope it can be a valuable resource for learning and inspiration for others.

Please note that the code and projects shared here represent my understanding and progress throughout the course. They may not be perfect or comprehensive representations of the topics covered but serve as a testament to my learning journey.

If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on any of the projects, please feel free to reach out. Happy exploring and learning!
